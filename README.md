# dynamic p - paths in grid

[pgame.py](./dynamicp.py) contains code to count possible paths in grid (from upper left to lower right)

uses recursive algorythm using dynamic programming technique to break problem into smaller sub problems

compares using memoization vs no memoization optimization of recursion
